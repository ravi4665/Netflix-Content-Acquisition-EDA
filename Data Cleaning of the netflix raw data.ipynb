    "## **1. Approach (Data Analysis)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Cleaning & Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle missing values in categorical columns like `rating_category`, `popularity_category`, and `vote_reliability`.\n",
    "* Drop irrelevant columns (already done). Keep only meaningful features for analysis.\n",
    "* Ensure proper data formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Convert categorical columns (`type`, `language`, `primary_genre`, `language_grouped`, `rating_category`, `popularity_category`, `vote_reliability`) into **category type**.\n",
    "  * Convert boolean flags (`recent_release`, `is_hit`) into **True/False**.\n",
    "  * Keep numerical columns (`rating`, `num_votes`, `popularity_score`, `engagement_score`) as numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Univariate Analysis (single variable):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution of `rating` (viewer ratings).\n",
    "* Distribution of `num_votes` (audience engagement).\n",
    "* Frequency counts of `type` (Movies vs TV Shows).\n",
    "* Popularity categories distribution (`popularity_category`).\n",
    "* Genre and language distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bivariate Analysis (two variables):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rating` vs. `type` → Do TV Shows or Movies have higher ratings?\n",
    "* `rating` vs. `primary_genre` → Which genres get better ratings?\n",
    "* `popularity_score` vs. `language` → Which languages are most popular?\n",
    "* `engagement_score` vs. `type` → Which format keeps viewers more engaged?\n",
    "* `is_hit` vs. `primary_genre` → Which genres deliver more “hits”?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multivariate Analysis (multiple factors):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Impact of **genre + type + release_year** on ratings.\n",
    "* Interaction between **language + genre** on popularity.\n",
    "* Which **combinations** (e.g., Korean Drama TV Shows, Spanish Comedy Movies) get both high ratings and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Trend Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yearly release trends: number of titles, ratings, and hits per year (`release_year`).\n",
    "* Genre evolution: Which genres gained/lost popularity over time.\n",
    "* TV Shows vs Movies over years: Is there a shift in audience preference?\n",
    "* Language trends: Growth of non-English content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outlier Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify **very low-rated** content (audience rejects).\n",
    "* Identify **exceptionally high-rated** and **high-engagement** titles (audience favorites).\n",
    "* Check reliability of outliers with `vote_reliability`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualization & Reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bar plots → Genres, Types, Languages distribution.\n",
    "* Histograms → Ratings, Votes distribution.\n",
    "* Box plots → Detect rating outliers.\n",
    "* Scatter plots → Ratings vs Votes, Popularity vs Engagement.\n",
    "* Line charts → Yearly and trend analysis.\n",
    "* Heatmaps → Correlation between numeric metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable:**\n",
    "A clear report showing **which genres, languages, and content types perform best**, guiding Netflix in **content acquisition & production strategy**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Expected Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content Type**: Whether Movies or TV Shows attract more engagement and ratings.\n",
    "* **Top Genres**: Which genres (Drama, Action, Comedy, Thriller) consistently perform best.\n",
    "* **Language Advantage**: Which languages (English, Korean, Spanish, Hindi, etc.) have the highest ratings and popularity.\n",
    "* **Audience Engagement**: Whether engagement is more strongly linked to `genre`, `language`, or `type`.\n",
    "* **Trend Shifts**: How preferences changed across release years (rise of K-Dramas, Spanish series, etc.).\n",
    "* **Outliers**: Spot hidden gems (very high-rated with few votes) or unexpected flops.\n",
    "* **Content Strategy**: Recommend specific combinations (e.g., “Korean Thriller TV Shows” or “Spanish Comedy Movies”) that Netflix should prioritize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Quality Issues**: Some categories may still have missing or noisy values.\n",
    "* **Outliers**: Extremely high or low ratings with few votes may distort analysis.\n",
    "* **Genre/Language Ambiguity**: Content may overlap multiple genres or languages.\n",
    "* **Audience Preferences Shift**: Trends are time-dependent and may change quickly.\n",
    "* **Interpretability**: Must present insights in a simple, visual way for non-technical stakeholders.\n",

    "## **4. Columns Description (Updated)**\n",
    "\n",

    "* **language** – Original language of the content.\n",
    "* **release_year** – Year when the content was released.\n",
    "* **rating_category** – Categorized rating (`Poor`, `Average`, `Good`, `Excellent`).\n",
    "* **popularity_category** – Categorized popularity (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very High`).\n",
    "* **engagement_score** – Score representing audience engagement (based on ratings + votes).\n",
    "* **vote_reliability** – Reliability of ratings based on number of votes (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).\n",
    "* **primary_genre** – Main genre classification (Drama, Action, Comedy, etc.).\n",
    "* **language_grouped** – Simplified grouped language categories (e.g., English, Korean, Spanish).\n",
    "* **recent_release** – Boolean indicating whether the title is recently released.\n",
    "* **is_hit** – Boolean indicating whether the title is classified as a \"hit\".\n"
